# Contributing guide

This page is for about contributing to Tuwunel. The
[development](./development.md) page may be of interest for you as well.

If you would like to work on an [issue][issues] that is not assigned, preferably
ask in the Matrix room first at [#tuwunel:tuwunel.chat][tuwunel-chat],
and comment on it.

### Linting and Formatting

It is mandatory all your changes satisfy the lints (clippy, rustc, rustdoc, etc)
and your code is formatted via the **nightly** `cargo fmt`. A lot of the
`rustfmt.toml` features depend on nightly toolchain. It would be ideal if they
weren't nightly-exclusive features, but they currently still are. CI's rustfmt
uses nightly.

If you need to allow a lint, please make sure it's either obvious as to why
(e.g. clippy saying redundant clone but it's actually required) or it has a
comment saying why. Do not write inefficient code for the sake of satisfying
lints. If a lint is wrong and provides a more inefficient solution or
suggestion, allow the lint and mention that in a comment.

### Running CI tests locally

<sub>TODO: docker bake matrix</sub>

### Matrix tests

CI runs [Complement][complement], but currently does not fail if results from
the checked-in results differ with the new results. If your changes are done to
fix Matrix tests, note that in your pull request. If more Complement tests start
failing from your changes, please review the logs (they are uploaded as
artifacts) and determine if they're intended or not.

If you'd like to run Complement locally using Nix, see the
[testing](development/testing.md) page.

[Sytest][sytest] support will come soon.

### Writing documentation

Tuwunel's website uses [`mdbook`][mdbook] and deployed via CI using GitHub
Pages in the [`documentation.yml`][documentation.yml] workflow file with Nix's
mdbook in the devshell. All documentation is in the `docs/` directory at the top
level. The compiled mdbook website is also uploaded as an artifact.

To build the documentation using Nix, run: `bin/nix-build-and-cache just .#book`

The output of the mdbook generation is in `result/`. mdbooks can be opened in
your browser from the individual HTML files without any web server needed.

### Inclusivity and Diversity

All **MUST** code and write with inclusivity and diversity in mind. See the
[following page by Google on writing inclusive code and
documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation).

This **EXPLICITLY** forbids usage of terms like "blacklist"/"whitelist" and
"master"/"slave", [forbids gender-specific words and
phrases](https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns#gender-neutral-pronouns),
forbids ableist language like "sanity-check", "cripple", or "insane", and
forbids culture-specific language (e.g. US-only holidays or cultures).

No exceptions are allowed. Dependencies that may use these terms are allowed but
[do not replicate the name in your functions or
variables](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation#write-around).

In addition to language, write and code with the user experience in mind. This
is software that intends to be used by everyone, so make it easy and comfortable
for everyone to use. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

### Variable, comment, function, etc standards

Rust's default style and standards with regards to [function names, variable
names, comments](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html), etc
applies here.

### Creating pull requests

Please try to keep contributions to the GitHub. While the mirrors of Tuwunel
allow for pull/merge requests, there is no guarantee I will see them in a timely
manner. Additionally, please mark WIP or unfinished or incomplete PRs as drafts.
This prevents me from having to ping once in a while to double check the status
of it, especially when the CI completed successfully and everything so it
*looks* done.

If you open a pull request on one of the mirrors, it is your responsibility to
inform me about its existence. In the future I may try to solve this with more
repo bots in the Tuwunel Matrix room. There is no mailing list or email-patch
support on the sr.ht mirror, but if you'd like to email me a git patch you can
do so at `maintainer@tuwunel.chat`.

Direct all PRs/MRs to the `main` branch.

By sending a pull request or patch, you are agreeing that your changes are
allowed to be licenced under the Apache-2.0 licence and all of your conduct is
in line with the Contributor's Covenant, and Tuwunel's Code of Conduct.

Contribution by users who violate either of these code of conducts will not have
their contributions accepted. This includes users who have been banned from
Tuwunel Matrix rooms for Code of Conduct violations.

### Branch Policy

##### This section applies to Matrix-Construct members and Tuwunel maintainers

All branches on the matrix-construct/tuwunel repository are _centrally
maintained_. They may be rebased without your consent. Trivial conflicts may be
resolved by another maintainer. Please resolve more difficult conflicts as soon
as possible. Personal forks are advised to reduce the workload on other
maintainers. Stale branches will be deleted to reduce the effort for this
policy.
