## Tuwunel project layout

Tuwunel uses a collection of sub-crates, packages, or workspace members
that indicate what each general area of code is for. All of the workspace
members are under `src/`. The workspace definition is at the top level / root
`Cargo.toml`.

The crate names are generally self-explanatory:
- `admin` is the admin room
- `api` is the HTTP API, Matrix C-S and S-S endpoints, etc
- `core` is core Tuwunel functionality like config loading, error definitions,
global utilities, logging infrastructure, etc
- `database` is RocksDB methods, helpers, RocksDB config, and general database definitions,
utilities, or functions
- `macros` are Tuwunel Rust [macros][macros] like general helper macros, logging
and error handling macros, and [syn][syn] and [procedural macros][proc-macro]
used for admin room commands and others
- `main` is the "primary" sub-crate. This is where the `main()` function lives,
tokio worker and async initialisation, Sentry initialisation, [clap][clap] init,
and signal handling. If you are adding new [Rust features][features], they *must*
go here.
- `router` is the webserver and request handling bits, using axum, tower, tower-http,
hyper, etc, and the [global server state][state] to access `services`.
- `service` is the high-level database definitions and functions for data,
outbound/sending code, and other business logic such as media fetching.

It is highly unlikely you will ever need to add a new workspace member, but
if you truly find yourself needing to, we recommend reaching out to us in
the Matrix room for discussions about it beforehand.

The primary inspiration for this design was apart of hot reloadable development,
to support "Tuwunel as a library" where specific parts can simply be swapped out.
There is evidence Conduit wanted to go this route too as `axum` is technically an
optional feature in Conduit, and can be compiled without the binary or axum library
for handling inbound web requests; but it was never completed or worked.

See the Rust documentation on [Workspaces][workspaces] for general questions
and information on Cargo workspaces.

## Adding compile-time [features][features]

If you'd like to add a compile-time feature, you must first define it in
the `main` workspace crate located in `src/main/Cargo.toml`. The feature must
enable a feature in the other workspace crate(s) you intend to use it in. Then
the said workspace crate(s) must define the feature there in its `Cargo.toml`.

So, if this is adding a feature to the API such as `woof`, you define the feature
in the `api` crate's `Cargo.toml` as `woof = []`. The feature definition in `main`'s
`Cargo.toml` will be `woof = ["tuwunel-api/woof"]`.

The rationale for this is due to Rust / Cargo not supporting
["workspace level features"][9], we must make a choice of; either scattering
features all over the workspace crates, making it difficult for anyone to add
or remove default features; or define all the features in one central workspace
crate that propagate down/up to the other workspace crates. It is a Cargo pitfall,
and we'd like to see better developer UX in Rust's Workspaces.

Additionally, the definition of one single place makes "feature collection" in our
Nix flake a million times easier instead of collecting and deduping them all from
searching in all the workspace crates' `Cargo.toml`s. Though we wouldn't need to
do this if Rust supported workspace-level features to begin with.

## List of forked dependencies

During Tuwunel development, we have had to fork
some dependencies to support our use-cases in some areas. This ranges from
things said upstream project won't accept for any reason, faster-paced
development (unresponsive or slow upstream), Tuwunel-specific usecases, or
lack of time to upstream some things.

- [ruma/ruma][1]: <https://github.com/matrix-construct/ruwuma> - various performance
improvements, more features, faster-paced development, better client/server interop
hacks upstream won't accept, etc
- [facebook/rocksdb][2]: <https://github.com/matrix-construct/rocksdb> - liburing
build fixes and GCC debug build fix
- [tikv/jemallocator][3]: <https://github.com/matrix-construct/jemallocator> - musl
builds seem to be broken on upstream, fixes some broken/suspicious code in
places, additional safety measures, and support redzones for Valgrind
- [zyansheep/rustyline-async][4]:
<https://github.com/matrix-construct/rustyline-async> - tab completion callback and
`CTRL+\` signal quit event for Tuwunel console CLI
- [rust-rocksdb/rust-rocksdb][5]:
<https://github.com/matrix-construct/rust-rocksdb-zaidoon1> - [`@zaidoon1`][8]'s fork
has quicker updates, more up to date dependencies, etc. Our fork fixes musl build
issues, removes unnecessary `gtest` include, and uses our RocksDB and jemallocator
forks.
- [tokio-rs/tracing][6]: <https://github.com/matrix-construct/tracing> - Implements
`Clone` for `EnvFilter` to support dynamically changing tracing envfilter's
alongside other logging/metrics things

## Debugging with `tokio-console`

[`tokio-console`][7] can be a useful tool for debugging and profiling. To make a
`tokio-console`-enabled build of Tuwunel, enable the `tokio_console` feature,
disable the default `release_max_log_level` feature, and set the `--cfg
tokio_unstable` flag to enable experimental tokio APIs. A build might look like
this:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo +nightly build \
    --release \
    --no-default-features \
    --features=systemd,element_hacks,gzip_compression,brotli_compression,zstd_compression,tokio_console
```

You will also need to enable the `tokio_console` config option in Tuwunel when
starting it. This was due to tokio-console causing gradual memory leak/usage
if left enabled.
